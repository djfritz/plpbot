### Reflections ###

This project gave me great insight into multiple aspects of engineering and I truly learned a lot. I learned a lot from our failures dealing with code that didn't work correctly most the time, I learned patience with not only just my team members, but from other groups, from the PLPBot, and from the coding itself. A lot of things didn't necessarily go our way, but as a group, as a unit, we worked through problems together. We didn't point fingers, we took responsibility as a whole group and hung together. This was not only a project I enjoyed working on, but a team that I enjoyed working on.
