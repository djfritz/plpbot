### Reflections ###

I was a member of the sensor team for this Computer Based Systems
project.  We were a great team because we were able to get along with
each other and everyone worked hard on trying to get the sensors
working properly.  In the end we were not able to get the sensors to
work fully for the project, but we were able to make them work pretty
well.  Even though we weren’t able to get the sensor code to fully work
for the project deadline, as a team we learned a lot about each sensor
and how each sensor operated.  We did a lot of extra research that was
not necessarily important that we know, but I think we were better
because of it.  We were able to come together as a team even though
things went wrong and we were able to learn from each other.

My role on the sensor team was code designer.  I think I could have
done a better job at helping the team out.  I think my lack of assembly
language and basic computer architecture knowledge limited me a little,
but just working with my team has benefitted a lot.  Whenever I was
first introduced to assembly language I had no idea what was going on
and didn’t have a clue what to do.  I have a better understand of how
assembly language works since I took the assembly code that we wrote
step by step so I could understand it.  I also learned a lot by
listening and discussing the code with my team members.  Overall I
think being on this team has helped my greatly in understand the
language better.
