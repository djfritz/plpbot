> ### Reflections ###


Sensor team is good team. Everyone was hard working. Even if we did not
do a perfect job, that is a good one. But still there are some aspects
need to be improved.

> Firstly, after getting a good plan, we did not follow it very
well. We spent too much time on designing and figuring out how to
calculate the speed. But finally, we were not supposed to do that.

> Secondly, as a lead engineering in sensor team, I did not do my
part very well. Even if I really made all effort to do all the things,
I cannot communicate with other people very smoothly, language barrier
prevent me a lot.
> Thirdly, I did not understand the architecture of the computer
very clearly, which made me could not understand the instruction very
well. In the end of the project, I was confused a lot about some basic
instructions.

> Anyway, it is a good experience for me to learn a lot of
things, such as assembly language, team work. I really enjoyed that.
Thanks all of you!
