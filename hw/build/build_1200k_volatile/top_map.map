Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,111 out of  17,344    6%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,847 out of  17,344   22%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,491 out of   8,672   28%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,491 out of   2,491 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,491   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,363 out of  17,344   25%
    Number used as logic:             2,951
    Number used as a route-thru:        516
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     896
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 92 out of     250   36%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of      28    3%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                1 out of      28    3%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.81

Peak Memory Usage:  417 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  6 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   6 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
